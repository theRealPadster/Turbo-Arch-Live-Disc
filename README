Turbo-Arch is a custom Arch Linux live disc preconfigured to be fully functional.
"So Arch doesn't take two days to set up!"

Setting up the development environment:
The disc is built with Archiso, which has documentation available here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso
One way of running it is to set up a chroot, and install archiso into it. See the link for more info: https://kroweer.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/creating-a-custom-arch-linux-live-usb/ The releng folder would then be placed into the directory mentioned in the tutorial, and updated with git. 

Right now, we actually have a somewhat weird system going on for building. This git project holds most of the files, but the disc is actually build with aLive, a project by "fluxer", which includes, aBuild, https://github.com/fluxer/aBuild, and aBoot, https://github.com/fluxer/aBoot.

-boots into GNOME-Shell
