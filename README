Turbo Arch Live Disc is a custom Arch live disc preconfigured to be fully functional. "So that Arch doesn't take two days to set up!"

Setting up the development environment:
The disc is build with Archiso, which has documentation available here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso
One way of running it is to set up a chroot, and install archiso into it. See the link for more info: https://kroweer.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/creating-a-custom-arch-linux-live-usb/ The releng folder would then be placed into the directory mentioned in the tutorial, and updated with git.

-boots into GNOME-Shell
-GUI installer
