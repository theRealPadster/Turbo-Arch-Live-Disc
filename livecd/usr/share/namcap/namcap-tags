# namcap tags file
# The tags file consists of lines specifying the human readable form of the 
# hyphenated tags used in the namcap code. A line beginning with a '#' is 
# treated as a comment. Otherwise the format of the file is:
#
#	machine-parseable-tag %s :: This is machine parseable tag %s
#
# Note that a double colon (::) is used to separate the hyphenated tag from the 
# human readable description.
